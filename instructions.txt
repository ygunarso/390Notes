2. Prepare a summary of the math we do up to the due date of this homework. Consider this prep for the midterm

integer overflow, floating point, hex, binary, conversion, and/or/xor/shifting

Deliverables
A guide showing how to install g++ or clang++ on MSYS2 under windows or Mac OSX. Your group can just pick one, you do not need to do both. To score the full 400 point consider doing both.
A guide showing every step of installing Raspberry Pi from noobs OS, installing g++, git, setting up ssh keys.
Diagrams showing key concepts in the course
Von Neumann Architecture
Harvard Architecture
How 128 bit arithmetic works with 32 bit numbers
All gates we cover (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR)
Truth tables for each of the above gates
How to construct
AND from NAND
OR from NOR
Adder from gates
Integer arithmetic for a 3-bit machine showing signed and unsigned numbers. You should convey how signed and unsigned numbers work and show examples showing the problems of overflow (ie 3 + 1 â†’ -4)
Floating point arithmetic showing the structure of float and double using the IEEE-754 standard.
