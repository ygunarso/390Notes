1. How to install Rasbian and get it working with your laptop
Include How to clone the git repo with the course notes (include setting up ssh)

2. Prepare a summary of the math we do up to the due date of this homework. Consider this prep for the midterm

integer overflow, floating point, hex, binary, conversion, and/or/xor/shifting

3. All linux commands you need to know to get around. Note I just created a repo, and everyone is expected to add EXACTLY one command. If you don't know one, ask me.

if you think there are missing commands, add them into the file called misc.txt.  Other people can use your ideas if they get stuck and add yours.

4. A list of all ARM assembler instructions we have covered in class.

The midterm will use the math and the ARM assembler so you can think of this part of the assignment as being study preparation for the midterm.

Deliverables
A summary of all the ARM instructions we cover in this course.
A guide showing how to install g++ or clang++ on MSYS2 under windows or Mac OSX. Your group can just pick one, you do not need to do both. To score the full 400 point consider doing both.
A guide showing every step of installing Raspberry Pi from noobs OS, installing g++, git, setting up ssh keys.
A summary of linux commands used including git commands
Diagrams showing key concepts in the course
Von Neumann Architecture
Harvard Architecture
How 128 bit arithmetic works with 32 bit numbers
All gates we cover (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR)
Truth tables for each of the above gates
How to construct
AND from NAND
OR from NOR
Adder from gates
Integer arithmetic for a 3-bit machine showing signed and unsigned numbers. You should convey how signed and unsigned numbers work and show examples showing the problems of overflow (ie 3 + 1 â†’ -4)
Floating point arithmetic showing the structure of float and double using the IEEE-754 standard.
