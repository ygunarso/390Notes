1. Number of transistors in the chip
2. Maximum amount of addressable memory
3. Maximum power utilization 
4. Raw CPU clock speed
5. Boost speed. Describe what boost clock is and how it works. What is the limiting factor?
6. Number of Cores
7. Number of clock cycles to read a memory location. Note you may have to do some research for this, read up on the system in question. It's not always a simple answer.
8. Amount of Cache. If there are multiple levels, describe each level.
9. Draw a system architecture of your CPU. You may take this from the manual but explain.

Estimate how long it would take on each architecture to:
1. Load two 32-bit numbers and add them
2. Load two 64-bit numbers and add them
3. Multiply two 32-bit numbers

Taking Job 1 as a standard (Load two 32-bit numbers and add them:
- Calculate computation/watt
- Calculate overall performance ratio of the three systems based on that number
- For example, if hypothetically the 6502 at 1Mhz takes 40uSec to add the numbers, and a modern machine does it in 12 * 3.5x10-9 seconds, then you would say that a modern computer is 40/12 * 3500 = 11,600 times faster.
