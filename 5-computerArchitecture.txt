Von Neumann Architecture:

Control Unit			|
Arithmetic Logic Unit	(ALU)	|- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
Memory Unit			|
Input/Output
Registers
- Memory Address Register		Store location of data to be accessed
- Memory Data Register			Store data to be accessed
- Accumulator				Store results of previous instruction
- Program Counter			Store address of next instruction
- Current Instruction Register		Store current instruction in processing
Buses
- Address Bus		Carry address of data between CPU and memory
- Data Bus		Carry data between CPU, memory, and input/output
- Control Bus		Carry control signals from CPU


Von Neumann Architecture vs. Harvard Architecture:

Memory
- Harvard Architecture: 	separate data and instruction busses
				allow simultaneous transfer on both data and instruction busses
				unified memory system -> inefficient
				two separate memory system -> perform better but difficult to implement
- Von Neumann Architecture:	one bus, which is used for both data and instruction transfers
				importance of scheduling and transfer cannot be simultaneous
				best for unified memory system

Cache
- Harvard Architecture:		separate caches for each bus
				used for higher performance systems
- Von Neumann Architecture:	single unified cache
				stores both instructions and data
